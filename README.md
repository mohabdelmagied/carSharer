# carSharer
This is project was part of the Database lab at the university of Duisburg Essen (Winter semester 2021/2022). In a team of two we have designed a car sharing web application that allow its users to create drives to share with others, reserve offered drives, search drives and find the best driver. It was implemented using Python-flask and DB2 server installed on the university's computer pool, the front end was implemented using HTML and CSS.
